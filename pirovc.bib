	abstract = {In metagenome analysis, computational methods for assembly, taxonomic profiling and binning are key components facilitating downstream biological data interpretation. However, a lack of consensus about benchmarking datasets and evaluation metrics complicates proper performance assessment. The Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) challenge has engaged the global developer community to benchmark their programs on datasets of unprecedented complexity and realism. Benchmark metagenomes were generated from newly sequenced {\textasciitilde}700 microorganisms and {\textasciitilde}600 novel viruses and plasmids, including genomes with varying degrees of relatedness to each other and to publicly available ones and representing common experimental setups. Across all datasets, assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes, while performance was substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below the family level. Parameter settings substantially impacted performances, underscoring the importance of program reproducibility. While highlighting current challenges in computational metagenomics, the CAMI results provide a roadmap for software selection to answer specific research questions.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Species identification and quantification are common tasks in metagenomics and pathogen detection studies. The most recent techniques are built on mapping the sequenced reads against a reference database (e.g., whole genomes, marker genes, proteins) followed by application-dependent analysis steps. Although these methods have been proven to be useful in many scenarios, there is still room for improvement in species and strain level detection, mainly for low abundant organisms. Results: We propose a new method: DUDes, a reference-based taxonomic profiler that introduces a novel top-down approach to analyze metagenomic NGS samples. Rather than predicting an organism presence in the sample based only on relative abundances, DUDes first identifies possible candidates by comparing the strength of the read mapping in each node of the taxonomic tree in an iterative manner. Instead of using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) we propose a new approach: the deepest uncommon descendent (DUD). We showed in experiments that DUDes works for single and multiple organisms and can identify low abundant taxonomic groups with high precision.

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bty567},
	abstract = {Motivation: Mapping-based approaches have become limited in their application to very large sets of references since computing an FM-index for very large databases (e.g. {\textgreater} 10 GB) has become a bottleneck. This affects many analyses that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full- text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about one day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times. Results: To solve the index construction and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor directories via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time. The second main contribution is an implementation of DREAM-Yara a distributed version of a fully sensitive read mapper under the DREAM framework.},

              Motivation
              The exponential growth of assembled genome sequences greatly benefits metagenomics studies. However, currently available methods struggle to manage the increasing amount of sequences and their frequent updates. Indexing the current RefSeq can take days and hundreds of GB of memory on large servers. Few methods address these issues thus far, and even though many can theoretically handle large amounts of references, time/memory requirements are prohibitive in practice. As a result, many studies that require sequence classification use often outdated and almost never truly up-to-date indices.
            
            
              Results
              Motivated by those limitations, we created ganon, a k-mer-based read classification tool that uses Interleaved Bloom Filters in conjunction with a taxonomic clustering and a k-mer counting/filtering scheme. Ganon provides an efficient method for indexing references, keeping them updated. It requires \&lt;55 min to index the complete RefSeq of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses. The tool can further keep these indices up-to-date in a fraction of the time necessary to create them. Ganon makes it possible to query against very large reference sets and therefore it classifies significantly more reads and identifies more species than similar methods. When classifying a high-complexity CAMI challenge dataset against complete genomes from RefSeq, ganon shows strongly increased precision with equal or better sensitivity compared with state-of-the-art tools. With the same dataset against the complete RefSeq, ganon improved the F1-score by 65\% at the genus level. It supports taxonomy- and assembly-level classification, multiple indices and hierarchical classification.

            Evaluating metagenomic software is key for optimizing metagenome interpretation and focus of the Initiative for the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI). The CAMI II challenge engaged the community to assess methods on realistic and complex datasets with long- and short-read sequences, created computationally from around 1,700 new and known genomes, as well as 600 new plasmids and viruses. Here we analyze 5,002 results by 76 program versions. Substantial improvements were seen in assembly, some due to long-read data. Related strains still were challenging for assembly and genome recovery through binning, as was assembly quality for the latter. Profilers markedly matured, with taxon profilers and binners excelling at higher bacterial ranks, but underperforming for viruses and Archaea. Clinical pathogen detection results revealed a need to improve reproducibility. Runtime and memory usage analyses identified efficient programs, including top performers with other metrics. The results identify challenges and guide researchers in selecting methods for analyses.},

	abstract = {Background: Fungi play a key role in several important ecological functions, ranging from organic matter decomposition to symbiotic associations with plants. Moreover, fungi naturally inhabit the human microbiome and can be causative agents of human infections. An accurate and robust method for fungal ITS classification is not only desired for the purpose of better diversity estimation, but it can also help us gain a deeper insight into the dynamics of environmental communities and ultimately comprehend whether the abundance of certain species correlate with health and disease. Although many methods have been proposed for taxonomic classification, to the best of our knowledge, none of them consider the taxonomic tree hierarchy when building their models. This in turn, leads to lower generalization power and higher risk of committing classification errors. Results: Here, we introduce HiTaC, a robust, hierarchical machine learning model for accurate ITS classification, which requires a small amount of data for training and is able to handle imbalanced datasets. HiTaC was thoroughly evaluated with the established TAXXI benchmark, characterizing its ability to correctly classify fungal ITS sequences of varying lengths and a range of identity differences between the training and test data. HiTaC outperforms state-of-the-art methods when trained over noisy data, consistently achieving higher accuracy and sensitivity across different taxonomic ranks, improving accuracy by 5.5 and sensitivity by 6.9 percentage points over top methods in the most noisy dataset available on TAXXI. Conclusions: HiTaC outperformed state-of-the-art taxonomic classifiers in most metrics. A user-friendly QIIME2 plugin allows users to easily include HiTaC in existing pipelines.

Detecting and removing true contaminants is challenging, especially in low-biomass samples or in studies lacking proper controls. Interactive visualizations and analysis platforms are crucial to better guide this step, to help to identify and detect noisy patterns that could potentially be contamination. Additionally, external evidence, like aggregation of several contamination detection methods and the use of common contaminants reported in the literature, could help to discover and mitigate contamination.We propose GRIMER, a tool that performs automated analyses and generates a portable and interactive dashboard integrating annotation, taxonomy, and metadata. It unifies several sources of evidence to help detect contamination. GRIMER is independent of quantification methods and directly analyzes contingency tables to create an interactive and offline report. Reports can be created in seconds and are accessible for nonspecialists, providing an intuitive set of charts to explore data distribution among observations and samples and its connections with external sources. Further, we compiled and used an extensive list of possible external contaminant taxa and common contaminants with 210 genera and 627 species reported in 22 published articles.GRIMER enables visual data exploration and analysis, supporting contamination detection in microbiome studies.

	abstract = {The fast growth of public repositories of sequences greatly contributes to the success of metagenomics applications. However, they are growing at a much faster pace than the resources to use them properly. This challenges current methods, which struggle to take full advantage of the massive and fast data generation. We propose a generational leap in performance and usability with ganon2, a sequence classification method that performs taxonomic binning and profiling for metagenomics analysis. It indexes large datasets with a small memory footprint, maintaining fast, sensitive, and precise classification results. This is possible with the Hierarchical Interleaved Bloom Filter data structure paired with minimizers and several other improvements and optimizations. Based on the full NCBI RefSeq and its sub-sets, ganon2 indices are on average 50\% smaller than state-of-the-art methods, providing a great compression rate for large and diverse genomic reference sets. Using 16 simulated samples from various studies, including the CAMI 1+2 challenge, ganon2 achieved up to 0.17 higher median F1-Score in taxonomic binning. In profiling, improvements in the F1-Score median are up to 0.32 keeping a balanced L1-norm error in the abundance estimation. ganon2 is one of the fastest tools evaluated and enables the use of larger, more diverse and up-to-date reference sets in daily microbiome analysis, improving the resolution of results.
