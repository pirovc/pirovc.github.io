	abstract = {Motivation: Species identification and quantification are common tasks in metagenomics and pathogen detection studies. The most recent techniques are built on mapping the sequenced reads against a reference database (e.g., whole genomes, marker genes, proteins) followed by application-dependent analysis steps. Although these methods have been proven to be useful in many scenarios, there is still room for improvement in species and strain level detection, mainly for low abundant organisms. Results: We propose a new method: {DUDes}, a reference-based taxonomic profiler that introduces a novel top-down approach to analyze metagenomic {NGS} samples. Rather than predicting an organism presence in the sample based only on relative abundances, {DUDes} first identifies possible candidates by comparing the strength of the read mapping in each node of the taxonomic tree in an iterative manner. Instead of using the lowest common ancestor ({LCA}) we propose a new approach: the deepest uncommon descendent ({DUD}). We showed in experiments that {DUDes} works for single and multiple organisms and can identify low abundant taxonomic groups with high precision.

	abstract = {Motivation: Mapping-based approaches have become limited in their application to very large sets of references since computing an {FM}-index for very large databases (e.g. {\textgreater} 10 {GB}) has become a bottleneck. This affects many analyses that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the {NGS} reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full- text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about one day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times. Results: To solve the index construction and update problem we propose the {DREAM} (Dynamic {seaRchablE} {pArallel} {coMpressed} index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor directories via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time. The second main contribution is an implementation of {DREAM}-Yara a distributed version of a fully sensitive read mapper under the {DREAM} framework.},

Here we analyze 5,002 results by 76 program versions. Substantial improvements were seen in assembly, some due to long-read data. Related strains still were challenging for assembly and genome recovery through binning, as was assembly quality for the latter. Profilers markedly matured, with taxon profilers and binners excelling at higher bacterial ranks, but underperforming for viruses and Archaea. Clinical pathogen detection results revealed a need to improve reproducibility. Runtime and memory usage analyses identified efficient programs, including top performers with other metrics.

              Motivation
              The exponential growth of assembled genome sequences greatly benefits metagenomics studies. However, currently available methods struggle to manage the increasing amount of sequences and their frequent updates. Indexing the current {RefSeq} can take days and hundreds of {GB} of memory on large servers. Few methods address these issues thus far, and even though many can theoretically handle large amounts of references, time/memory requirements are prohibitive in practice. As a result, many studies that require sequence classification use often outdated and almost never truly up-to-date indices.
            
            
              Results
              Motivated by those limitations, we created ganon, a k-mer-based read classification tool that uses Interleaved Bloom Filters in conjunction with a taxonomic clustering and a k-mer counting/filtering scheme. Ganon provides an efficient method for indexing references, keeping them updated. It requires \&lt;55 min to index the complete {RefSeq} of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses. The tool can further keep these indices up-to-date in a fraction of the time necessary to create them. Ganon makes it possible to query against very large reference sets and therefore it classifies significantly more reads and identifies more species than similar methods. When classifying a high-complexity {CAMI} challenge dataset against complete genomes from {RefSeq}, ganon shows strongly increased precision with equal or better sensitivity compared with state-of-the-art tools. With the same dataset against the complete {RefSeq}, ganon improved the F1-score by 65\% at the genus level. It supports taxonomy- and assembly-level classification, multiple indices and hierarchical classification.

Interactive visualizations and analysis platforms are crucial to better guide this step, to help to identify and detect noisy patterns that could potentially be contamination. Additionally, external evidence, like aggregation of several contamination detection methods and the use of common contaminants reported in the literature, could help to discover and mitigate contamination.We propose {GRIMER}, a tool that performs automated analyses and generates a portable and interactive dashboard integrating annotation, taxonomy, and metadata. It unifies several sources of evidence to help detect contamination. {GRIMER} is independent of quantification methods and directly analyzes contingency tables to create an interactive and offline report. Reports can be created in seconds and are accessible for nonspecialists, providing an intuitive set of charts to explore data distribution among observations and samples and its connections with external sources. Further, we compiled and used an extensive list of possible external contaminant taxa and common contaminants with 210 genera and 627 species reported in 22 published articles.{GRIMER} enables visual data exploration and analysis, supporting contamination detection in microbiome studies.

Moreover, fungi naturally inhabit the human body and can be beneficial when administered as probiotics.

Hence, an accurate and robust method for {ITS} classification is not only desired for the purpose of better diversity estimation, but it can also help us gain a deeper insight into the dynamics of environmental communities and ultimately comprehend whether the abundance of certain species correlate with health and disease. Although many methods have been proposed for taxonomic classification, to the best of our knowledge, none of them fully explore the taxonomic tree hierarchy when building their models. This in turn, leads to lower generalization power and higher risk of committing classification errors.},
